Notes from developer this project:took me a lot longer than it really should take to complete. 
I was able to get the website working, but it was a lot of work. I had to do a lot of research and testing to get everything working. 
I also had to learn how to use Bootstrap and how to use JavaScript to make the website interactive. 
I also had to learn how to use Google Maps API to display the location of the event center. 
I also had to learn how to use JavaScript to make the menu page interactive. 
I also had to learn how to use JavaScript to make the contact form interactive.
i also found that i can use AI to create the below README file, which is a great time saver for me.
i also want those that view this page that the products in the menu are fake and there is no checkout.
at the same time the event page has links to actually book a seat at that actual event.
this is a little tribute to Jessie Reyes and her family. 
thank you for viewing my project.
